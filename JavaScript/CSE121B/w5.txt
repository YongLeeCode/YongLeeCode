Database design
-Organizing data to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity and consistency

Normal Forms
-A set of rules that, if applied to data, reduces data redundancy and increases data integrity.

First Normal Form (1NF)
-Each cell of the table should only have one single (scalar) value and there should be no repeating columns. The table should also have a primary key

Second Normal Form (2NF)
-Every non-key column must depend on the entire primary key (both parts of a composite primary key)

Third Normal Form (3NF)
-Every non-key column must depend only on the primary key (a single value primary key)

De-normalizing
-Ignoring some normal forms if it improves performance of a database
