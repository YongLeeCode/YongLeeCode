The gospel of repentance
First step:
He must admit to himself that he has sinned, without the slightest minimization of the offense or rationalizing of its seriousness, or without soft-pedaling its gravity. He must admit that his sin is as big as it really is and not call a pound an ounce.

“For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation.” (2 Cor. 7:10.)

Second step:
 “By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them.” (D&C 58:43.) And to the adulteress, the Master said, “Go, and sin no more.” (John 8:11.)

In the process of abandoning a sin, it is often necessary to abandon persons, places, things, and situations that are associated with the transgression.

Last step : forgiveness
Remember this, that forgiveness can never come without repentance. 
“Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven.” (D&C 1:31–32.)
