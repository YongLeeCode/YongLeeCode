GOAL
(What are the most important things we want to learn from this study - the overall goals/questions to answer?)

Study how to make a good app.

Hypotheses(how to make a good app?)
- to know what actual users really focus on in the app
- to know what parts users are annoying in the app
- to know what users expect in the app
- to know whether the app is useful or not
- to know what interface and design are comfortable for users.



Hypotheses
Survey results:
-The total punches and total redeemed seems majorly unnecessary and can be cut out
	
 -a simple 2 step verification would be good. EX. “Buy Now” and then “Confirm Purchase”
	
 -For the owned items. Something punch card themed was requested. Either a picture of a punch car or and picture of a stamp would be good.
	
 -The majority of users wanted the owned punch card Icon to be in the bottom left corner.
	
- Search and filter should be at the top of the screen. 
	
 -Round rectangle edges. 
	
 -Be wary of too much empty space.
	
 -most people said that the filter button should be located at the top right of the screen. But if there is no header, then it should be in the bottom left.
	
 -Most people for their favorite venues, it was a toss-up between a heart and a bookmark. An Icon to reach the bookmarked items. People Currently like the position of the bookmark on the home page
	
 -Most people like seeing the virtual punches on the card more. 
	
 -If there are more than 10 stamps on a card, then a number would be better. Maybe just put a number in the corner regardless.
	
 -Most people want a QR Code over a button that says, “Use Now”. It is more professional.
