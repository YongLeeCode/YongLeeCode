What is good body language?
These five are good examples of in-person

1.Rubbing Hands Together Briskly
This is a way of communicating that an individual is excited for something or is waiting in anticipation. By using this gesture, people understand your exciting feeling perfectly.

2.Palms Open and Facing Upward
An open palm is a sign of openness and honesty.

3. Standing Straight With Shoulders Back
This position shows that a person is feeling confident of himself or herself.

4. Stroking Your Chin or Beard
When one strokes the chin, he or she is communicating deep thought. It indicates thoughtfulness and interest.

5. Leaning In
By acting this, they can feel you are interested in them.

-----------------------------------------------
Good examples for virtual

1. set up your screen perfectly
If you do not set up your screen, people will think that you are not ready for online meeting.

2. Using good hand gestures
A study by Holler and Beatie found that gestures increase the value of our spoken message by a massive 60%, and the most acclaimed  ‘Ted Talkers’ use twice as many hand gestures than those with a lower appreciation score.

3. Head-nodding
While people speak, listeners provide cues of understanding through what linguists call “backchanneling.
The most prominent example of backchanneling is head-nodding.
Nod your head to let them know that you are listening.

4. don't forget to smile
The face is one of your body and is one of the most visible part. Espcially, the online meeting.
Smiling relieves stress, lowers our blood pressure and boosts the immune system.

After I studied the good body language, I figured out one thing.
과도한 제스처나 상황에 맞지 않는 제스처를 사용하면 사용하지 못한것보다 좋지 않은 결과가 나올 수 있다는 것을 명심해야한다.
It's important to keep in mind that excessive or inappropriate gestures in any situations can have worse consequences than not using them even if good gestures.
