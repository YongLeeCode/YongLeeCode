Edgar F. Codd
 - A computer scientist who invented the relational model for database management, the theoretical basis for relational databases and relational database management systems

SQL
 - Structured Query Language, the language to communicate with a database

MySQL
 - the most popular open-source relational database management system

MySQL Workbench
 -  a visual tool for database providing data modeling, SQL development, administration tools, user administration, and backups

Table
 - a part of a database that represents one real world entity or one group of related instances of that entity. Each row of a table is one instance of the entity. Each column an attribute of that entity.

Primary Key
 - An attribute (or group of attributes) that uniquely identifies a given entity in a table

Foreign Key
 - A primary key of one table that appears as an attribute in another table and acts to provide a logical relationship between the two tables. Foreign keys can repeat.

Referential Integrity
 - A rule that prevents invalid relationships between tables when changes are made to the data

Null
 - A term stating that an attribute value doesn't have to exist. In other words the user can leave the value blank

Auto-increment
 - A table column which produces a sequential system generated number when a new record is inserted into a table.

Surrogate Key
 - A system-assigned primary key, generally numeric and auto-incremented.

Composite Key
 - Two or more attributes that together define the primary key by unique combinations of their values.

Natural Key
 - A key that naturally occurs in the attributes of an entity, such as a student ID or a course name.

ERD
 - Entity Relationship Diagram - a diagram that shows how database tables are defined and relate

Cardinality (Entity Relationships)
 - How the occurrences in one entity are linked to the number of occurrences in another entity (one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many)

Crows feet notation
 - a way to symbolize relationships between tables in an entity relationships diagram (ERD)

RDBMS:
The Relational Database Model is the most common.
-relational

Each table represents a 'real-world' entity.
- table 

The primary key must be unique for each row of the table.
- unique

The same primary key value of one table can be used as a foreign key value of another table to relate them together.
- foreign

___ not only uniquely identifies a row of a table but it also is made up of real-data, data that has meaning and occurs naturally in the real world.
- natural

___ key gets an auto-generated value from the computer system as the row is added to the table.
-surrogate

Entity Relationships:
There are 3 types of relationships between entities. A one-to-one, a one-to-many, and a many-to-many .
- many-to-many

In a one-to-many relationship, a customer can make many orders but an order is made by only one customer.
-one

In relational databases, a many-to-many relationship always has to be resolved or broken down into  2 one-to-many relationships.
-manytomany
